# Constant Work
Constant work is the opposite of bimodal load patterns. It is a patttern where load is optimized for consistency across a wide variety of situations, as opposed to efficiency.

* [Reliability, constant work, and a good cup of coffee](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/reliability-and-constant-work/) discusses constant work from the perspective of a coffee urn, where amount of work is irrespective of load.
* Also mentioned in Mark Brooker's [review of the 2021 DynamoDB paper](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2022/07/12/dynamodb.html)
