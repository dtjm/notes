# Universal Theory of Maturity

Common themes found when looking at how people, skills, organizations, organisms, and people groups evolve.

There is a commonly seen pattern that starts at infancy:
- Concepts are spoon-fed
- Rules are strict

As the subject matures, they gain more freedom and their expression moves out of rigid rules to essence. 

The Israelites received the Law from Moses, but Jesus brought the Spirit, the essence of the Law.  Jesus fulfilled the Law, but was not a slave to the Law.

Similarly, we teach children morality starting with rules, but as they get older, we transition them to principles ([[[fe44f846]]]).
